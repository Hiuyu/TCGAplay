# TCGAplay

Motivation: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, https://cancergenome.nih.gov/) provides us with an enormous collection of data sets, not only spanning a large number of cancers but also a large number of experimental platforms. 

## Cancers Selected for Study
TCGA has chosen cancers for study based on specific criteria that include:
- Poor prognosis and overall public health impact
- Availability of human tumor and matched-normal tissue samples that meet TCGA standards for patient consent, quality and quantity

Below is a list of cancers that have been selected for study based on the criteria outlined above. The TCGA program has collected the necessary quality and quantity of samples for these cancers to move them into the TCGA project pipeline. Scheduling for sequencing and characterization for these cancers will be dependent on the capacity of the project pipeline. To view TCGA's clinical data forms, please visit the Biospecimen Core Resource's website (http://www.nationwidechildrens.org/biospecimen-core-resource-clinical-data-forms).

TCGA is no longer accepting additional samples for characterization. 
Analysis is underway in the following Analysis Working Groups (AWGs):
- 1 Cervical cancer
- 2 Cholangiocarcinoma
- 3 Esophageal carcinoma
- 4 Liver hepatocellular carcinoma
- 5 Mesothelioma
- 6 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
- 7 Paraganglioma & Pheochromocytoma
- 8 Sarcoma
- 9 Testicular germ cell cancer
- 10 Thymoma
- 11 Uterine carcinosarcoma
- 12 Uveal melanoma
